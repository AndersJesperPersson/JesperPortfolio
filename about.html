        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>
          Born and raised in Falkenberg. Spent my youth travelling before I decided to educate me. Settle down 
          in Lund during 3,5 years and graduated, 2018, as a Socionom. Met the girl of my life, moved to Gothenburg and 
          and started to work as a therapist on a clincal focused on eating disorders. 
          Time went by, my currious soul realised that there are more things in the world that I want to learn.  
          One day on the tramp on my way home, by coincidence, I lay my eyes on one of the posters. Suddenly I realised, that is my upcoming project 
          - I wanna learn how to code.   
        </p>
        <p>
        From that day I started out back home, just to get a touch of it and see if I had any talent at all. 
        Forever grateful to youtube, udemy and stack overflow. The community of coders are just somethinge else. Now days I wouldn´t call my self talented but I´m for sure a 
        quick learner. I was stimulated and stuck, this is definitely 
        something I wanna keep doing. I applied to the program .NET-developer at Campus Mölndal and got admitted, on a 
        condition, I had to pass a brief course because of my lack of previous knowledge. Said and done, the course was great and a perfect start on my new journey.       
        </p>
        <p>
          After six months in school, mostly learing C# and SQL, I started to search for companies. Like a proactive action to see where I wanna do my internship (that is a part of the education). 
          I got in touch with a company called Centiro, in Borås, by a friend that recommended me. We had a great talk for almost an hour and in the end of the conversation they asked me if I was interessted 
          to work for them during the summer. Thrilled and excited, I got my first job, only six month after I decided to switch carrier. I could now call my self an application specialist. 
          That was a great experience to get out in the "real life", doing things we been learning in school but on way much bigger scale. I learnt many new ways how data can be transfered and benefits with integrated systems. 
          Regarding my contribution I felt I did an okay job. Apparently good enough beacuse in the end of the summer I was offered to stay on board and helping out in parallel to my studies. 
        </p>
        <p> As it seems right now, I´ll do my internship at Centiro, but I don´t close any doors. Don´t hesitate to <a class="reach-out" href="view/contact.html">reach out</a> 
          to me, give me a PM if you reckon I would be a good fit. Or if you just more interested about me. <br></p>
          <p class="last-sentence"> Ciao! </p>
